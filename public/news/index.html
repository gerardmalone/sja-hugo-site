Message from Father Peter:
After a wonderful Christmas, we can now look forward to what I hope is a Happy and Holy New Year for us, perhaps especially Holy, as Pope Francis declares 2025 to be a Holy Year, which he officially opened when entering St. Peter’s Basilica through the ‘Holy Door’ on Christmas Eve beginning ‘a Jubilee of Hope’ praying, ‘Grant that the church may bear faithful witness to your love and may shine forth as a vital sign of the blessed hope of your kingdom’. This Holy Year calls us to ‘Pilgrims of Hope’, as Pope Francis said, calling us ‘to spiritual renewal and committing us to the transformation of our world, so that this year may truly become a time of jubilation: A jubilee for our mother Earth, disfigured by profiteering; a time of jubilee for the poorer countries burdened beneath unfair debts; a time of jubilee for all those who are in bondage to forms of slavery old and new.’ Throughout the year, let us pray the Official Holy Year prayer (which will be distributed on cards soon): Father in heaven, may the faith you have given us in your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, and the flame of charity enkindled in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, reawaken in us the blessed hope for the coming of your Kingdom. May your grace transform us into tireless cultivators of the seeds of the Gospel. May those seeds transform from within both humanity and the whole cosmos in the sure expectation of a new heaven and a new earth, when, with the powers of Evil vanquished, your glory will shine eternally. May the grace of the Jubilee reawaken in us, Pilgrims of Hope, a yearning for the treasures of heaven. May that same grace spread the joy and peace of our Redeemer throughout the earth. To you our God, eternally blessed, be glory and praise for ever. Amen. A beautiful prayer for this New Year – and any Year.">

<p><strong>Thank You:</strong><br>
First of all, let me thank everyone who has helped make our beautiful Christmas Masses so special, but in doing so, I’m really thanking everyone who works so hard throughout the year for us all here at SJSP’s. So many people who work in the Church and Sacristy, on the Altar, around the Church, behind the scenes, in the gardens and grounds, in the house and the Office, in our church and house buildings, in our organ lofts and our choir benches and musician areas, and in our bell Towers, in our amazing Schools and in all our work with our young people, in our Parish Halls, and in our Parish Hall kitchens, in raising funds and ministering to those outside the Church, and in our own homes and families; and huge thanks to our friends and Deacons Michael and David. We already know we are blessed to be such a wonderful community, so let’s continue to gratefully receive and celebrate God’s blessings, and share them with others throughout this coming year. Amen. FrP.</p>
